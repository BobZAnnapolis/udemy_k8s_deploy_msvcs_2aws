Section 22. The Alert Manager

- 88. Temp problems w/Alert Manager
  - 2 September 2020:
    Just to warn you, the Helm chart for Prometheus Operator has been updated in the last few days, and it has
    caused several variations from what you see on the videos in this section. I am working on a fix for this
    right now, I am aiming to get a revised version published as soon as possible this September.

    In the meantime, I recommend just watching the videos in this section. When I've updated the course, you'll
    be able to apply a yaml file which will enable you to replicate what you see on the videos.

    I'm sorry for this; it was a serious mistake to use Helm to install prometheus-operator. It illustrates a
    major problem with Helm - you lose the ability to control exactly what is being deployed to your cluster.

    I'll post an announcement when the re-worked section is ready.
