Section 29. RBAC - Role Based Access Control on a K8S Cluster

- 115. A note for EKS users
  - If you're working with EKS, then you won't be able to use the Authentication method (certificates) that
  we use in this section. For that reason, I'm currently working on a new version of this section, especially
  for EKS. I'll push out an announcement when this new section is ready.

  In brief, if you're using EKS and you need multiple users to access the cluster, then you use IAM to create
  users, which is a very different approach to the one I use in the following videos.

- 116. Defining Roles
  - 

- 117. Defining RoleBindings
- 118. Setting up a "context" for the user
- 119. Issuing a K8S Cluster X.509 Certificate
- 120. Installing the user's certificate
- 121. Allocating Access to Users
- 122. ClusterRoles & ClusterRoleBindings
