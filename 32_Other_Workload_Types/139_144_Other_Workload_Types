Section 32. Other Workload Types

- 139. Batch Jobs
  - does create a pod
  - k8s makes sure it runs to completion
  - eg, report, finds accounts to be abandoned
  - "restartNever" tag : Never
    - w/o this - after it completes, k8s will restart
  - these kinds of jobs stay active/visible - SysAdmins need to manually review & delete

- 140. Cron jobs
  - backoffLimit - # times k8s should re-schedule the job when it fails
  - time-based scheduled jobs

- 141. DaemonSets
  - ensures that ALL NODES run a copy of a pod
  - RARE that in a microservice application will need to have the same msvcs on every node
    - EXCEPTION : ELK STACK - NEED FLUENTD RUNNING ON EVERY NODE
  - change "kind:Deployment" to "kind:DaemonSet" & get rid of 'replicas' {redundant in a daemonset}

- 142. StatefulSets Overview
  - manage deployment and scaling of a set of pods;
  - provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these pods
  - NOT used for PERSISTENCE, ie data lives longer than lifetime of pod
    - this is accomplished by creating dbs attached to a volume, using s3, etc
  - SOMETIMES YOU NEED A SET OF PODS WITH PREDICTABLE NAMES
    - eg, CLIENTS NEED TO BE ABLE TO CALL THEM BY THEIR NAME
      - certain software needs to access known named
  - pods will always have a name
  - will start in sequence
  - clients can call them by name

- 143. StatefulSets for Database Replication
  - Usual Use :
    - You have a database
    - You want to replicate it
    - DBs can't usually be replicated by simple ReplicaSets/Deployments
      - DBs need to know who is primary / secondary
      - client needs to know which one is primary as well {BAD}

- 144. Demo : Scaling Out a Mongo DB
  - SUGGESTION : TRY TO MAKE YOUR DBs OUTSIDE OF YOUR CLUSTER
  - K8S : NO SPECIAL SYNTAX FOR "HEADLESS SERVICE" :-(
