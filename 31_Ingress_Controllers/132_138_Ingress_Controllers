Section 31. Ingress Controllers

- 132. Introducing Ingress
  - 2 ways to access services
    - kubectl get svc {on minikube}
    - NodePort : our webapp
    - ClusterIP : not accessible outside the cluster
  - want users to access our system thru webApp
  - admins need to access some others, eg queue,
  - can only use ports in range 30000+
    - could for testing functionality
  - the REAL WAY to access apps are thru LoadBalancers
  - cloud providers offer these
    - highly available, highly resilient
  - YAML : specify LoadBalancer
    - go thru port 80 to route traffic to service
    - PROBLEM : ok for only 1 service - if multiple services - need a different solution
      - do NOT want to have separate LBs for each service
        - ok cuz they'll each have port 80 - but then for many svcs - don't want 1-to-1 service-LB ratio
          -since LBs are expensive - don't want to have multiple LBs
  - some cloud providers provide 'Application Load Balancers' - not very portable between different cloud providers
  - can make this functionality work using "Ingress Controller"
  - just have 1 Load Balancer, listen on any port - usually 80 - cfg it to talk to 1 svc - Ingress Controller
    - commonly implemented as NGINX
      - based on cfg rules - will make routing decisions for us
  - still need a Load Balancer {usually only need 1, but can replicate for resiliency}
    - handles requests from multiple nodes

- 133. Defining Routing Rules
  - allows us to define routing rules to route requests to appropriate services
  - in minikube
    - addons ingress
  - i can't do cuz i can't start my version with the --vm=true parameter
  - another YAML file
    - see chapter files
  - specify "kind: Ingress"

  - ADDED "fake" DOMAIN NAMES in /etc/hosts specifying host address - NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PROD - GOOD FOR TESTING
  -

- 134. Adding Routes
  -

- 135. Authentication
  - NGINX Ingress Controller w/k8s
    - can create secrets for generic authentication to test userid-pw
  - htpasswd tool
    - use "test" credentials
  - BASIC AUTH credentials are USUALLY REMEMBERED BY BROWSER - COULD BE A PROBLEM
    - need to clear cookies/data

- 136. Running Ingress on AWS
- 137. Testing the Ingress Rules
- 138. extra : setting up HTTPS w/TLS termination at the load balancer
