Welcome to K8S
==============

Container Orchestration systems, many
- Kubernetes, k8s, most popular {for now}

Docker
- containerization system
- deploy individual parts of a system in containers

- divide up an application into separate containers / microservices

- difficult to manage as separate containers, have to monitor using monitoring tools
- too cumbersome -

- solution : Orchestration Systems
  - used to manage containers
  - use manifests to
    - define entire architecture
      - robustness
      - disk solution to use
      - images / containers to use
      - restore to a steady-state w/no manual intervention

- Docker Swarm has its own orchestration system
  - part of Docker Engine installation

- Docker Swarm simpler
- K8S far richer / powerful / popular
  - easier to use manifests and move up to Cloud
