- Services
  - webapp pods NOT accessible / visible inside a cluster using a browser
  - why ? pods are throwaways
    - taken down / started frequently
  - service is a long-running objects
    - will have an IP address
    - will have a stable fixed port
  - POD LABELs
    - key:value pairs to identify pods, >=1
  - SERVICE SELECTOR
    - specify the pod LABELs to 'connect' to it

- NodePort and ClusterIP
  - ClusterIP
    - only accessible inside the Cluster
    - eg, used for microservices, internal comms
  - NodePort
    - accessible via a browser, usually just the web apps
    - ONLY use any port # > 30000

- Pod Selection w/Labels
  - wasn't working according to the course, however,
  - when i entered this command : minikube service fleetman-webapp0 --url
  - it gave me the correct URL to use in order to access the landing page

- COMMANDS :
   91  kubectl apply -f webapp-service.yaml
   93  kubectl apply -f first-pod.yaml
  101  kubectl get all
  102  minikube ip
